🌍 NDWI-Based Water Change Detection (1994–2024)

This project analyzes long-term surface water dynamics using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). It focuses on calculating water-covered areas, detecting spatio-temporal changes, and visualizing results in both maps and charts for research and decision-making purposes.

✨ Features

Compute NDWI from satellite imagery (Landsat series).

Extract water-covered areas for selected years (1994, 2004, 2014, 2024).

Perform change detection analysis to identify water gained and lost areas.

Calculate total water area (sq.km) for each year.

Generate professional visualizations (maps, charts, and graphs).

Export results (CSV/GeoTIFF) for further analysis in Python.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Google Earth Engine (JavaScript API) → NDWI calculation & change detection.

Python (Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas) → Data visualization & research-ready charts.

Landsat datasets (Landsat 5 and 8).

📊 Research Applications

Monitoring surface water distribution over time.

Assessing the impact of climate change and land-use changes.

Supporting water governance and resource management.

Providing reproducible methods for remote sensing-based environmental studies.
